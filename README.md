# Zero

Zero is an AI property manager, an AI employee that works inside [cf0](https://cf0.ai) for property management, lettings and short-term rental firms. This plugin lets your team hand Zero its follow-ups from Claude, ChatGPT or Codex.

## How it works

You hand Zero the follow-ups your team would otherwise chase by email, such as arranging access with a tenant for a repair, confirming a check-out time with a guest, or telling an owner about booked work. Each task is about one person on your firm's records. To add someone new, Zero first shows you their name, email, role and property, and adds them only after you agree. Zero plans the task and drafts an email from your firm's own Zero mailbox. Someone at your firm previews and approves the email, in chat or on cf0.ai, and nothing is sent before that. Zero then sends it, reads the reply and closes the task once the person confirms. If they suggest a different time or ask something only your team can answer, Zero asks you first and drafts its reply for your approval.

Every task stays on your firm's board in cf0, with a record of what Zero sent and when.

## What it does

- **Ask Zero** (`ask_agent`, read-only): what Zero is handling, what is waiting on you, and where a task stands. It changes nothing and contacts no one.
- **Give Zero a task** (`give_agent_task`): hand Zero one task about one person on your firm's records, or about someone new that you agree to add, such as arranging access with a tenant for a repair visit, confirming a check-out time with a guest or telling an owner about booked work. Zero drafts one email from your firm's own Zero mailbox and sends it only after someone at your firm approves it.
- **Answer Zero** (`answer_agent`): approve or decline an ordinary email after a preview, answer a question Zero asked about your task, or cancel a task.

People on your firm's records appear as reference codes such as `p_k7mq2xrb4a` with their role, and contact details and access codes are hidden. A name that is not on your firm's records, such as one typed into the chat, is passed back as written. Zero never takes leasing, leads, cold outreach, marketing, tenant screening, rent or arrears, payments, legal notices or emergencies. Messages to 10 or more people, documents and sensitive content can only be approved on cf0.ai.

## What is in this package

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `plugin.json`, `mcp.json` | Agent Plugins manifest and MCP server for ChatGPT and Codex |
| `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `.mcp.json` | Plugin manifest and MCP server for Claude |
| `skills/zero-property-manager/SKILL.md` | How your assistant works with Zero, using the three tools |
| `assets/` | Zero logos and composer icons, light and dark |

The plugin runs no local code, hooks or commands. Its one connection is the remote MCP server at `https://api.cf0.ai/mcp`, operated by cf0. When you connect, your assistant asks you to sign in with your cf0 account through OAuth. Each request then carries your question or task, and Zero answers from your firm's workspace in cf0. Nothing is sent anywhere else.

## The plugin and a cf0 contract

To talk to cf0 about a contract, book a demo at [cf0.ai](https://cf0.ai).

## Before you connect

You need a cf0 account as a member of a firm on cf0. Before Zero takes tasks, an admin sets up billing on cf0.ai (a firm on a cf0 contract skips this step), cf0 gives Zero an email address for your firm, and your team adds the people Zero emails, on cf0.ai or from chat. Until then, every answer lists the steps that are missing, with a link to Setup on cf0.ai.

Setup steps for each assistant are at [cf0.ai/support](https://cf0.ai/support#assistants).
